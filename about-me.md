1. I have used Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, and JavaScript.
2. In the past, most of the programming I've done has been for classes. I've made websites and basic programs.
3. Most notable project I worked on was for CS222. My team made a recipebook mobile application that stored entered recipes to a local JSON document. For this, I worked mainly on the storage and retrieval of data from the JSON.
4. I feel most comfortable working on the logic operations in the back-end.
5. I am least comfortable working on UI elements.
